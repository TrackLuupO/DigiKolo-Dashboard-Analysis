# 🔍 Key Findings

###  1\. 💸 Wallet Activity Trends

\- **Observation**: Wallet funding is highest in early periods (possibly Q1), followed by inconsistent inflows.  
\- **Interpretation:** New users may show early enthusiasm but taper off due to lack of recurring incentives or unclear app value.  
\- **Opportunity**: Introduce reward-based gamification and consistent reminders for wallet top-ups.

### 2\. 💰 Product Engagement (Savings)

\- **Observation**: "DigiSave" holds a dominant share among savings products.  
\- **Interpretation:** Users prefer structured savings plans with visible goals and returns.  
\- **Opportunity:** Promote goal-based savings with visual progress bars and personalized recommendations.

---

### 3\. 📈 Interest Distribution

\- **Observation:** Interest earned is concentrated within a small set of users/products.  
\- **Interpretation:** High-value users or specific plans are delivering better returns.  
\- **Opportunity:** Analyze plan profitability and market those with high returns to new users.

### 4\. 📉 Inconsistent Wallet Recharges

\- **Observation:** Decline in wallet top-ups over time suggests user drop-off.  
\- **Interpretation:** Onboarding and sustained engagement might be weak.  
\- **Opportunity:** Implement simplified onboarding, referral bonuses, and feedback-triggered retention workflows.  
---

### 5\. 🕒 Time-Series Behavior

\- **Observation:** User actions (savings, interest, and wallet funding) are more active during specific periods.  
\- **Interpretation:** Monthly salary cycles, public campaigns, or marketing pushes influence this behavior.
